          </div>
          <p>The Yale Journalism Initiative began in 2006 with a generous grant from Steven Brill ’72 LAW ’75, the founder of <i>The American Lawyer</i> magazine and Court TV, and his wife, Cynthia Margolin Brill ’72. It has since benefited from the generosity of Bob Woodward ’65 and Elsa Walsh. Its mission is to encourage and equip students in Yale College, and in its graduate and professional schools, who aspire to contribute to democracy in the United States and around the world by becoming journalists.</p>

            <h2>A LEGACY OF EXCELLENCE</h2>
          </div>
            <p>Many of the country’s finest journalists are Yale graduates, including Bob Woodward, Tom Wolfe, former <i>Harper’s</i> editor Lewis Lapham, <i>National Review</i> founder William F. Buckley, former <i>Slate</i> editor Jacob Weisberg, <i>New Yorker</i> staff writer Jane Mayer, <i>New Yorker</i> staff writer and MacArthur Fellow Sarah Stillman, and Propublica.org editor-in-chief Paul Steiger. The Yale Journalism Initiative is designed to help current Yale students take their places in this tradition.</p>

            <h2>A NETWORK OF SUPPORT</h2>
          </div>
          <p>Believing that the best preparation for a career in writing is a broad, liberal-arts education, Yale does not offer a journalism major. There are numerous opportunities at Yale to study writing and to work for student publications, and the Initiative aims to further support certain students, those selected as Yale Journalism Scholars, with an intensive journalism seminar in the English department; career counseling; support for summer internships; talks by visiting journalists; and access to an extensive alumni network.</p>
