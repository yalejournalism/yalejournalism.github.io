__The Yale Journalism Initiative is in the midst of developing our own jobs and internships search resource. In the meantime, these are the best resources:__

 
1. Most summer internships and jobs in journalism are not posted online or in internship books; they are the result of unique arrangements made between interested students and editors. For help in finding the best possible internship to match a student’s interests, and for assistance in arranging such internships and applying for funding to help make them possible, Yale Journalism Scholars should write to the Initiative’s coordinator, [Mark Oppenheimer](mailto:mark.oppenheimer@yale.edu).

2. The four best sites for summer journalism internships and for jobs after graduation are [this site maintained by New York University](https://journalism.nyu.edu/career-services/fellowships-and-annual-programs/), University of California at Berkeley’s excellent [jobs site](https://journalism.berkeley.edu/jobs/), the industry site [mediabistro.com](https://www.mediabistro.com/), and the industry site [journalismjobs.com](http://www.journalismjobs.com/index.php).

3. [Ed2010](http://ed2010.com/) is also a useful site for jobs.

4. Yale students looking for jobs and internships may wish to consult with Yale’s [Office of Career Strategy](http://ocs.yale.edu/). 

5. Many Yale alumni have expressed an interest in speaking with students about careers in journalism. Their names and contact information are available through the Association of Yale Alumni.

6. More internships for college students are listed on the web site of the [American Society of Newspaper Editors](http://asne.org/).

7. Students looking for international reporting opportunities can find English-language newspapers all over the world by consulting [www.thepaperboy.com](https://www.thepaperboy.com/index.cfm).

8. Students who write for The Yale Daily News may apply for internships through the OCD (“Oldest College Daily” board) by writing to [John Zucker](mailto:john.w.zucker@abc.com) '76.

9. Many publications now list job openings on their web site, often not listing them elsewhere (examples include The New Republic, The Nation, and Buzzfeed, but there are many more). If there’s a publication (or radio station, TV station, podcast, etc.) that you are interested in, visit its website or contact editors there directly; don’t assume that its openings are posted elsewhere.
